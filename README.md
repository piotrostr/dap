## Contract requirements:

- Taxes as a base : 20% split into 10% party 8% marketing 2% auto liquidity

- Need a base buy and sell tax in the first few mins of 99% to prevent botting

- an increased sell for the first 30min-hour of 50% then base as usual.
  (bots dont use slippage so they get instafucked)

- The 99% tax at the beginning goes all into the marketing wallet with no max buy during the 5 mins

- then tax reverts to normal after we rug the bots

- Change contract name a few times up to launch potentially to prevent sniper but if we rugging
  sniper anyway should be fine

- Lock wallets 6 months

- Transfer ownership to my wallet( new wallet ill make)

- Be able to withdraw from the contract
